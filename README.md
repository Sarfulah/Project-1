# Project-1

## Overview
This project was the collaborative result of three coders: Nick Marcionese, Sarjulah Stewart, and Jim Latta. The goal of this project was to rollout an MVP within 7 days; the result can be viewed here [insert link]. Our group elected to pursue the development of an application in the healthcare field, a sector of the U.S economy burdened by onersome regulation and plagued by systemic inefficiencies, bureaucracy, and asymmetrical incentives. Our team designed a product with the aim of streamlining the search process by which a consumer can filter search results for medical professionals by geographic proximity, symptoms displayed, and insurance. 

To acheive all of the above, code had to be developed that would integrate javascript functions with multiple data points from distinct APIs - the medical professionals, the insurance providers, and zip codes. Next, multiple arrays had to be built to compare data pulled from separate arrays in order to ascertain cohesion. This required multiple for loops and if clauses. Due to the multi-facted design requirements of this project, separate branches on Git Hub were created in order to carefully merge work without incident. 


## Key Challenges
* Integrating multiple server-side APIs
* Ensuring Javascript functionalities correspond 
* Managing Git branching workflow

## Future Development
Later development from the MVP would ideally include the following: 
1. A per-click and/or per-registration revenue stream developed in server-side APIs
2. Search criteria defined by age groups (e.g. children vs adults)
3. API that aggregates and stores all data
